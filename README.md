# 2048: CS400 Edition

> Recreating the game 2048 using JavaFX

## Motivation

The problem is that thereâ€™s is not a fun enough, yet intellectually stimulating, game made with JavaFX.

## Concept

On a 4x4 playing board, the player can slide all the squares up, down, right, and left. If two squares with the same number slide into each other, they will combine into a single square with an incremented number. The player's goal is to combine the numbered squares until they reach 2048. They lose once the playing board is filled up and they can no longer combine any more squares.

## Notes to the Grader

Upon losing, the game will prompt the player to enter their name onto the leaderboard. The player's name and score will be stored in a priority queue (ordered by greatest score). This form will not show if they access the leaderboard via the main menu.
